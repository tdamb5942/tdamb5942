## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tom.

I'm a Junior Data Engineer looking for my first permanent role.

My main skills are in Python, AWS, SQL. I write clean, readable code using modern tooling and test-driven development and enjoy the continuous learning that is necessary to stay u-to-date a sa developer.

Since April 2025 I've been working at[ IMU biosciences](https://www.imubiosciences.com/) as a Data Engineer. I am building data pipelines for patients' clinical and demographic data in Python using pandas for data transofrmation, AWS for storage/hosting, and Dagster for orchestration. My work at IMU uses [this profile](https://github.com/tom-ashford-imu). This is a fixed term contract (paid internship) ending in July 2025.

In March 2025 I graduated from the [Northcoders](https://www.northcoders.com/) Data Engineering in Python Bootcamp. `The capstone project of the course was, as a team, to build a cloud-hosted ETL pipeline for a fictional business. You can see the repo [here](https://github.com/tdamb5942/bootcamp-data-pipeline-project)

Additionally, I have begun working on a personal coding project [here](https://github.com/tdamb5942/loyverse-sales-reports) that extracts, transforms, and visualizes sales data from the Loyverse POS API to enable category-level filtering and period-on-period performance comparisons.
